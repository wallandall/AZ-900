## Governance
Governance in Azure is one aspect of Azure Management. [This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/azure-management) covers the different areas of management for deploying and maintaining your resources in Azure.

Management refers to the tasks and processes required to maintain your business applications and the resources that support them. Azure has many services and tools that work together to provide complete management. These services aren't only for resources in Azure, but also in other clouds and on-premises. Understanding the different tools and how they work together is the first step in designing a complete management environment.

The following diagram illustrates the different areas of management that are required to maintain any application or resource. These different areas can be thought of as a lifecycle. Each area is required in continuous succession over the lifespan of a resource. This resource lifecycle starts with the initial deployment, through continued operation, and finally when retired.
