## Machine Learning 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of a computer to imitate intelligent human behavior. Through AI, machines can analyze images, comprehend speech, interact in natural ways, and make predictions using data.

[Machine learning (ML)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/ai-overview) is an AI technique that uses mathematical algorithms to create predictive models. An algorithm is used to parse data fields and to "learn" from that data by using patterns found within it to generate models. Those models are then used to make informed predictions or decisions about new data.
