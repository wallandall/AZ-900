# Security

## Securing Network Connectivity
- [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview) is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.
- [Distributed denial of service (DDoS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview) attacks are some of the largest availability and security concerns facing customers that are moving their applications to the cloud. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application's resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet.

## Microsoft Defender for Cloud
[Defender for Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.

Defender for Cloud provides the tools needed to harden your resources, track your security posture, protect against cyber attacks, and streamline security management. Because it's natively integrated, deployment of Defender for Cloud is easy, providing you with simple auto provisioning to secure your resources by default.

## Key Vault
[Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) helps solve the following problems:

Secrets Management - Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets
Key Management - Azure Key Vault can be used as a Key Management solution. Azure Key Vault makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
Certificate Management - Azure Key Vault lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.

## Azure Information Protection
[Azure Information Protection (AIP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.

## Microsoft Defender for Identity
[Microsoft Defender for Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/what-is) (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection, also known as Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Defender for Identity enables SecOp analysts and security professionals struggling to detect advanced attacks in hybrid environments to:

Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics
Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory
Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain
Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage

## Azure Sentinel

[Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview) is a scalable, cloud-native, security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution. Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for attack detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

Microsoft Sentinel is your birds-eye view across the enterprise alleviating the stress of increasingly sophisticated attacks, increasing volumes of alerts, and long resolution time frames.

- Collect data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.

- Detect previously undetected threats, and minimize false positives using Microsoft's analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence.

- Investigate threats with artificial intelligence, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft.

- Respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.



## Azure Dedicated Hosts
[Azure Dedicated Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts) is a service that provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.
